Research and Professional Experiences
=====================================

7 research papers published and 2 patents authorized. (see the appendix)

2009.07 -- 2013.11  Research Associate, Department of Space Optics
------------------------------------------------------------------

In Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics (CIOMP), China Academy of Sciences (CAS).
                   
I was engaged in R&D for key technologies in space optics and instruments. I was
mainly in charge of design and optimization of frame structures and lens, computer-
aided alignment and assembly. I am familiar with structural analysis and testing. In the
meantime, I designed some nonstandard fixtures.

During the time,I have participated in R&D of four aerospace instruments projects.

* Participated in the fabrication, assembly and verifying testings of one advanced
  research project of optical instrument for CAS.
* Participated in R&D of a optical imaging instrument for State High-Tech Development
  Plan (863 Program), mainly in design and optimization of mainframe
  structure and lens supports, and in charge of assembly, alignment and testing of
  the instrument.
* Participated in R&D of a optical instrument, mainly for assembly and alignmeng
  and related testings.
* Participated in the structural design, assembly and alignment, and testings of one
  advanced research project of optical instrument for CAS.
* Working Skills:
  
  – Design and optimizing of structures, mechanisms and optical elements, using
  CAD/CAE tools such as UGS NX、SolidWorks、AutoCAD、Patran/Nastran, etc.
  – Postprocessing and optimizing of data from assembly, alignment and tests of
  products with Matlab/Python.
  – Familiar with whole processes of optical instrument manufacturing, from con-
  cepts of design, detailed design to verification with CAE tools and tests, and from
  fabrication to mounting and alignment.
  
2007.07 -- 2009.06  Research on micro-/nano- fluid in Micro-/Nano- Electro-Mechanical Systems
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During postgraduate.

Using Molecular Dynamics (MD) and multiscale computing methods to simulate micro-/nano-fluid
phenomena and electroosmotic fluid. Basing on their microscopic mechanism,
we explored their application in micro-/nano-fludic chips. This work was supported by the
State High-Tech Development Plan (863 Program) project ”Development of Modeling
Software for Biological Micro-/Nano-Fluidics.” (Grant NO. 2006AA04Z305).

* MD simulation software was developed using C/Python, and auxiliary pre-/post-
  processing codes were also developed using Python/Bash.
    
Education
=========

* 2007.09 — 2009.06  Master of Engineering (Recommended for admission) 
  in Design and Theory of Mechanics, Jilin University, China.
* 2003.09 — 2007.06  Bachelor of Engineering (summa cum laude), 
  in Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Jilin University, China. 
  (3 times of First-Class Scholarship and Unversity Outstanding Student,
  one time of Second-Class National Scholarship.).
