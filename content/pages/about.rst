:summary: About me.

This is the place simply for recording various things about me, Crick Zhang,
a plain researcher in China. I got a MSc degree in theory of mechanical
design (in 2009) and a BSc degree in mechanical engineering (in 2007) from
JLU of China. Astronomy, physics, computing, and machinery are all my interests.

I am now living in China. In spare time, I like reading and singing.
